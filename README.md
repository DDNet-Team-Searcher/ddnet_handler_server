# DDTS Rust Server
Basically... i send requests here from the website. And then this thing handles ddnet servers

## Info
To build this shit you would need a tool called protoc. If you are true gentoo gigachaf, run

    emerge --ask dev-libs/protobuf

or if you are a normie who uses ubuntu

    apt install protobuf-compiler
and then you can run as any other rust program
